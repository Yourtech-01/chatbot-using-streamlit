# Customer Support Chatbot using Streamlit and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning based customer support chatbot developed using Python.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and provide automated responses.
A Streamlit web interface is used to create an interactive and user-friendly chatbot application.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙ How the Chatbot Works
1. User enters a message through the Streamlit web interface.
2. The input text is transformed using TF-IDF vectorization.
3. A trained machine learning model predicts the user intent.
4. Based on the predicted intent, the chatbot returns a predefined response.
